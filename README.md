# IMArduino
Repository for the development of an NYUSH IMA Barebones Arduino Uno clone kit.

The goal of this project is to develop a DIY Arduino clone kit that would allow users to manually build their own Arduino Uno clones. The value of this kit is that it has pedagogical value and can also serve as a functional replacement for standard Arduino Uno for many uses.
